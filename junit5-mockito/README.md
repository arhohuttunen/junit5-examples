# Using Mockito with JUnit 5

This is the accompanying source code for the article [Using Mockito with JUnit 5](http://www.codingrevolution.com/junit-5-mockito/).

These examples demonstrate how to:

- Create mocks manually, being independent of JUnit version (or any other framework)
- Create mocks with the `@Mock` annotation, along with `MockitoAnnotations.openMocks()`
- Use the `MockitoExtension` to initialize the mocks
- Use the `@InjectMocks` annotation in case where setter or property injection is needed
