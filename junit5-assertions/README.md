# JUnit 5 Assertions: Verifying Test Results

This is the accompanying source code for the article [JUnit 5 Assertions: Verifying Test Results](http://www.codingrevolution.com/junit-5-assertions/).

This example demonstrates how to assert that:

- values are equal
- an object is null or not null
- a value is true or false
- arrays or iterables are equal
- objects are same by value or reference
- the code throws an exception
- the test running time does not exceed a value

In addition, it will show how to provide a custom error message when on assertion failure. Furthermore, it will show how to group and report several conditions together.
